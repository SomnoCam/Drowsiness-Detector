# **Driver Drowsiness Detector**

## **Introduction**
The **Driver Drowsiness Detector** is a **prototype project** aimed at exploring the feasibility of detecting driver drowsiness using computer vision and machine learning techniques
The system is designed to study how real-time monitoring can identify **signs of drowsiness** and issue alerts before accidents occur

### ‚ùó **Disclaimer**  
 **This is a research prototype and NOT a finalised commercial solution**  
The project is in its **development phase**, and further enhancements are needed for real-world deployment

### **üõ†Ô∏è Current Features**
The system detects:
- **Prolonged eye closure**
- **Frequent yawning**
- **Abnormal head tilt (nodding off)**  

When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers **immediate alerts** (sound, vibration, or visual) to help the driver stay alert or take a break

## **Why is this Research Important**
- **18%** of fatal accidents are linked to driver fatigue
- **6,700 deaths** in 2021 in the U.S. were caused by drowsy driving
- After **20 hours without sleep**, a driver‚Äôs reaction time is as slow as someone with an illegal blood alcohol level

üí° **Traditional methods like drinking coffee or opening a window are ineffective**  
A data-driven, AI-based approach could provide more reliable drowsiness detection

## **System Architecture**
The prototype consists of **four main components**:

### **Infrared (IR) Camera**
- Captures real-time video of the driver‚Äôs face
- Works **both day and night**
- **Compatible with glasses** (minimizing reflection issues)

### **Edge AI Processing Unit**
- Runs real-time fatigue detection algorithms
- Compatible with:
  - **Raspberry Pi 4**
  - **NVIDIA Jetson** (for AI acceleration)
- **Advantages:**
  - No Internet connection required
  - Ultra-fast processing with low latency

### **Detection Algorithms**
- **Facial landmark detection** using OpenCV and deep learning
- **Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR):** Detects prolonged eye closure
- **Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR):** Detects yawning
- **Head Pose Analysis:**  
  - If the head tilts forward or sideways ‚Üí Increased fatigue risk

### **Alert System**
- **Sound alerts** (buzzer or voice prompt)
- **Seat or steering wheel vibration**
- **Message display on the dashboard screen**
  
## **Installation**
### **Hardware Requirements**
- **Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB RAM minimum)**
- **IR Camera (NoIR Camera Module or IR Webcam)**
- **Buzzer and/or LED for alerts**
- **(Optional) Accelerometer/Gyroscope for additional head movement data**

### **Software Installation**
